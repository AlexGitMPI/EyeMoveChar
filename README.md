# Workflow description 
Here we explain the PYTHON script processing and any manual steps in sequential order. 

## Base Code
This Python script is used to extract all the necessary data from the respective files in the "data" folder. In order to run the script successfully, all the files need to be downloaded 
and the script updated (source names) to direct it to the correct files. Run the individual subscripts one after another.
